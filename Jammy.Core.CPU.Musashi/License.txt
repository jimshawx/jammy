INTRODUCTION:
------------

Musashi is a Motorola 68000, 68010, 68EC020, 68020, 68EC030, 68030, 68EC040 and
68040 emulator written in C.  This emulator was written with two goals in mind:
portability and speed.

The emulator is written to ANSI C89 specifications.  It also uses inline
functions, which are C9X compliant.

It has been successfully running in the MAME project (www.mame.net) for years
and so has had time to mature.
